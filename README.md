This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Follow the page to complete your tasks.

## Hints

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You should visit [MUI](https://mui.com/) to find what are the available MUI components to use. Build as many components as you need to in `src/components` folder.

Add any other dependencies you might need to to help you complete your tasks.

## Provided Material

**Files you must change**

We've provided the following files which we expect you will change:

- `src/app/page.tsx` update the code to complete required tasks.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` if you added other dependencies to help you complete your tasks.

## Submission Format

Please ZIP your project folder, including a `.git` directory with at least one commit, and provide this to our recruiter.

**Alternatively**

You can submit the GitHub url of your repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. We will check that you have correctly followed the instructions per this document.

2. After reviewing your code, we will attempt to run your solution and evaluate if the required tasks have been completed.

3. We will score your submission against:

   - Code Design
   - Quality
   - Error Handling
   - Code Performance
   - Security
   - Documentation

## Time Limits

We expect a solution can be completed within 1-3 hours total development time.

Please do not attempt to add additional features we have not asked for. We want a working solution which addresses our evaluation criteria - nothing more.

If you do not believe you can complete a solution in under 3 hours, please let us know. We do not "police" this time limit - it simply exists to be respectful of your time.
